## F.A.Q.

**Q: Why does the program ask for firewall permissions?**

A: We use [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/) and [Nucleus](https://nucleus.sh/) to obtain telemetry information of the program mainly for automatic error reporting and to obtain real-time application information.

We do not store any personal information or photos that have been processed with the program, everything is kept securely on your computer, if you prefer you can use the program in offline mode or disable telemetry.

## âš  Drastic Changes in v1.0.0+

Because DreamTime has been the **victim of users who take the source code and sell it without complying with the LICENSE conditions**, we are forced to implement certain very unfriendly changes for an open-source project, we apologize for all the inconvenience this may cause, these changes are **temporary** until DreamTime has been noticed on social networks to prevent people from falling into a possible SCAM.

To avoid an alert with information from DreamTime
when you start your program, please make sure you **don't change the name or type of license** on your fork.
